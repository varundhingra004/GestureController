# Replace Mouse actions with Hand Gestures.
This is my capstone project for my Master of Science degree.

Often, when typing on the laptop one comes accross a situation of one's hand brushing accidently against the track pad of the laptop. When this happens, the cursor also move to a differnt part of the screen which results in many typing errors. I thought of a way to get rid of this issue by trying to replace the mouse/trackpad with hand gestures. This thus eliminates the need for a single hardware like the mouse/trackpad.

In this project, I have simulated three mouse actions - single click, double click and mouse move with hand gestures involving the index finger and the thumb.
